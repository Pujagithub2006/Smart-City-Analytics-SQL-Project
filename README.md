# Smart City Analytics: SQL Project

## ðŸŒŸ Project Overview
This SQL-based project provides deep insights into urban city data using advanced SQL techniques. The goal is to analyze multiple aspects of a smart city like citizen details, electricity usage, healthcare visits, public feedback, and transport usage. The project is structured into levels, covering from basic to advanced SQL topics including:

- Joins and aggregations  
- Grouping and filtering  
- Subqueries  
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)  
- Window functions  

---

## ðŸ“Š Datasets and Tables
The project involves **6 normalized tables** representing key smart city domains:

1. **city_area** â€“ Master data for city zones and areas  
2. **citizens** â€“ Citizen demographics and area linkage  
3. **electricity_usage** â€“ Monthly electricity consumption and bills  
4. **healthcare_visits** â€“ Healthcare department-wise visit tracking  
5. **public_feedback** â€“ Ratings and feedback for public services  
6. **transport_usage** â€“ Transport mode and fare history  

Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is included in the repo for better understanding of schema relations.

## ðŸ”¹ Features and Concepts Covered

### 1 - Basic SELECT & JOINs
- Merging tables using inner joins  
- Simple filters using `WHERE`  
- Sorting and aliases  

### 2 â€“ Aggregation & GROUP BY
- `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`  
- `GROUP BY` with `HAVING`  
- Multi-level grouping  

### 3 â€“ Subqueries
- Nested subqueries for comparisons  
- Correlated subqueries  
- Filtering with `NOT IN`, `EXISTS`  

### 4 â€“ CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
- Modular queries using `WITH`  
- Layered analytics  
- Summary and detail breakouts  

### 5 â€“ Window Functions
- `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`  
- `LAG()` and `LEAD()`  
- Running totals with `SUM() OVER`  
- Combined use of CTE + window functions  

---

## ðŸ’° Sample High-Impact Insights
Some of the valuable business insights derived include:

- Citizens with highest healthcare expenses  
- Feedback sentiment trends by department  
- Areas with above-average electricity bills  
- Weekly electricity consumption trends  
- Transport cost ranking per citizen  
- Running total of electricity usage per area
